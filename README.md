## TODO:
1. improve UI and autoplay video. or autoshow images
2. Set up cert bot automated renewal.

* Write the front end with ReactJS (https://reactjs.org/).
* If using github pages or gitlab pages to avoid additional costs, we'd need to somehow create a static HTML file from the data on a regular basis and then push that file to the website repository to simulate a dynamic website. Need more research if going this route.
