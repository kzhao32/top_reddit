# top_reddit

## TODO:
1. Figure out Let's Encrypt for HTTPS.
2. Create HTML/CSS/JS for a single reddit post.
3. Create a React component out of the HTML/CSS/JS for the single reddit post.

* Write the front end with ReactJS (https://reactjs.org/).
* If using github pages or gitlab pages to avoid additional costs, we'd need to somehow create a static HTML file from the data on a regular basis and then push that file to the website repository to simulate a dynamic website. Need more research if going this route.
