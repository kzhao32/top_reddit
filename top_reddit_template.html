				<h3>TIFU by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage</h3>
				<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story. </p> <p>I visited Thailand in September &#39;15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. This meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and I never felt OK jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so I decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. I was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous. </p> <p>One morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on Koh Samui, I decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. After a little splash around I used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, I didn&#39;t think much of it. I then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious Pad Thai. </p> <p>I suffer from ongoing back pains, so when I hit Thailand I took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. Now, considering how vulgar my username is, I am actually bit of a prude. I didn&#39;t want any &quot;rug and tug&quot; situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once I start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? Not that I&#39;m chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. So, after being a little drunk and full of food I decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down. </p> <p>This wasn&#39;t one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. I went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. I asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought I was after anything &quot;extra&quot;) and got ready. It was only when I started taking my sweatpants off that I remembered that I was free-balling, I explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst I awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse. </p> <p>The first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones I&#39;d had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (I&#39;m a big fan of more aggressive massages), I was in absolute bliss. Then came the time for the front. Look, by this point I had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had &quot;awoken the beast&quot; to some level or another. With this massage I was at absolute full-mast. One of those &quot;I&#39;ve not jerked off in three weeks&quot;, my dick actually aches type of stonkers. I apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. She laughed and started working on my legs, I started relaxing a bit more, I imagined it was nothing she hadn&#39;t seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. She went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch I imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. I went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock. </p> <p>Cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that I thought I&#39;d broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but I also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. All the while I&#39;m desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. Mostly despair. After a short while, the fireworks were over. There was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. I realised that I&#39;d been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this Gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. Wordlessly I put my clothes on, not making eye contact, I pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 Baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. I often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation. </p> <p>Edit - Typos</p> <p>TL; DR - Got a massage forgetting my underwear, ended up shooting my wad all over myself, a poor masseuse and her equipment in a furious display of penile theatrics.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PM_ME_YER_TITTAYS"> /u/PM_ME_YER_TITTAYS </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/"> r/tifu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6izh3/tifu_by_blowing_my_load_absolutely_everywhere/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6izh3/tifu_by_blowing_my_load_absolutely_everywhere/">[comments]</a></span>
